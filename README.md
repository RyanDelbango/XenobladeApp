The api may need to load after the first click of the core crystal if the site has been inactive for a little while. The site will work quickly and efficiently after that.

This is a mock-up promotional website for one of my favorite games Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Click on the "Core Crystal" and a random character from the game will pop up. There is a description of the character and a link to buy the game. In the game, when a character touches a "Core Crystal" a new character will join your team depending on which character touched it. This application is based off of other "Which character am I?" applications prevelant across the internet where a user can relate to a description of a character.
